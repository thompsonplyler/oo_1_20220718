### Announcements

- Tom's Lab Help tonight @ 6pm EST.
- We are still grading code challenges and projects
  - It's not over, but it should be.
- New language jitters (JavaScript as heiroglyphics again)

### SWBAT

- [] Explain the purpose of Object Orientation and why it's a popular design pattern
- [] Explain what a factory object is

- [] Observe how to create a class and an instance
- [] Explain the difference between a class and an instance
- [] Explain the difference between a getter and setter method
- [] Explain the purpose of mass assignment
- [] Observe initialization via mass assignment

### Deliverables

- use the `bundle add` command to install pry and `colorize` gems
- use `require` and `require_relative` to load up required dependencies and code (within `config/environment.rb`)
- Create a Dog class
- add an initialize method to allow instantiation (first with a series of arguments, then with a hash of attributes)
- Add `attr_accessors` for `name`, `age`, `breed`, `image_url`, `last_walked_at`, and `last_fed_at`
- Use data within `lib/dogs_data_rb` file to create instances of dog class that respond to setters and getters
- Add a `print` method to the dog class that will print out its information in the console.
